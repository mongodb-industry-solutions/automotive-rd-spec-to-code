# C++ & Rust Bazel Template Repository

This repository serves as a **template** for setting up **C++ and Rust projects** using **Bazel**.
It provides a **standardized project structure**, ensuring best practices for:

- **Build configuration** with Bazel.
- **Testing** (Component and Feature Integration Tests).
- **Documentation** setup.
- **CI/CD workflows**.
- **Development environment** configuration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-score/YOUR_PROJECT.git
cd YOUR_PROJECT
```

### 2️⃣ Build the Examples of module

> DISCLAIMER: Depending what module implements, it's possible that different
> configuration flags needs to be set on command line.

To build all targets of the module the following command can be used:

```sh
bazel build //score/...
```

This command will instruct Bazel to build all targets that are under Bazel
package `score/`. The ideal solution is to provide single target that builds
artifacts, for example:

```sh
bazel build //score/<module_name>:release_artifacts
```

where `:release_artifacts` is filegroup target that collects all release
artifacts of the module.

> NOTE: This is just proposal, the final decision is on module maintainer how
> the module code needs to be built.

### 3️⃣ Run Tests

All tests:

```sh
bazel test //...
```

Unit tests:

```sh
bazel test //score/...
```

Component / Feature integration tests:

```sh
bazel test //tests/...
```

## 🛠 Tools & Linters

The template integrates **tools and linters** from **centralized repositories** to ensure consistency across projects.

- **C++:** `clang-tidy`, `cppcheck`, `Google Test`
- **Rust:** `clippy`, `rustfmt`, `Rust Unit Tests`
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated builds and tests

---

## 📖 Documentation

- A **centralized docs structure** is planned.
- This template builds Sphinx from the repository root. The configuration stays in
    `conf.py`, the main document is `docs/index.rst`, and the root `BUILD` target uses
    a repository-local `docs.bzl` wrapper because the upstream SCORE docs macro does not
    currently support `source_dir = "."`.

```sh
bazel run //:docs
```

---

## ⚙️ `project_config.bzl`

This file defines project-specific metadata used by Bazel macros, such as `dash_license_checker`.

### 📌 Purpose

It provides structured configuration that helps determine behavior such as:

- Source language type (used to determine license check file format)
- Safety level or other compliance info (e.g. ASIL level)

### 📄 Example Content

```python
PROJECT_CONFIG = {
    "asil_level": "QM",  # or "ASIL-A", "ASIL-B", etc.
    "source_code": ["cpp", "rust"]  # Languages used in the module
}
```

### 🔧 Use Case

When used with macros like `dash_license_checker`, it allows dynamic selection of file types
 (e.g., `cargo`, `requirements`) based on the languages declared in `source_code`.
